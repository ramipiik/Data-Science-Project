**Explanations of variables**
- Sensible heat flux gapfilled = The conductive heat flux from the Earth's surface to the atmosphere.
- Latent heat flux = Heat flux from the Earth's surface to the atmosphere that is associated with evaporation of water at the surface and subsequent condensation of water vapor in the troposphere.
- NEE gapfilled = Net CO2 exchange with the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide is absorbed by plants during photosynthesis and released during respiration, a process with occurs in both plants and soils. The balance of this absorption and release, called net ecosystem exchange, serves to reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations.
- NEE gapfilling method = This contains the flag parameter for NEE gapfilled (0 = no gapfilling applied).
- Diffuse PAR = Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) is light of wavelengths 400-700 nm and is the portion of the light spectrum utilised by plants for photosynthesis. Diffuse PAR is PAR scattered by air molecules.
- Rainfall = Amount of rainfall (collected at bucket at 18m).
- Precipitation = Amount of water in the form of rain, snow etc.
- Air temperature at 16.8 m and 33.6 m
- Monoterpene flux = Amount of monoterpene exchanged between biosphere and atmosphere.
- Soil water potential = Soil water potential expresses how much energy you would need to expend to pull that water out of the soil sample, effects evaporation, transpiration, and ability of plants to absorb water.
- Soil water content
