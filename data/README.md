**Explanations of variables**
List of variables with short descriptions of what they represent. For more techical aspects, see group folder: Data Science Project > variables.xlsx

Evapotranspiration gapfilled = Amount of water that moves from land to atmosphere through evaporation and transpiration. (Evaporation = water from soil, transpiration = water from plants).

Gross primary production = Total amount of CO2 assimilated by plants per unit time through the photosynthetic reduction of CO2 into organic compounds.

Sensible heat flux gapfilled = The conductive heat flux from the Earth's surface to the atmosphere.

Latent heat flux = Heat flux from the Earth's surface to the atmosphere that is associated with evaporation of water at the surface and 
subsequent condensation of water vapor in the troposphere.

NEE gapfilled = Net CO2 exchange with the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide is absorbed by plants during photosynthesis and released during respiration, a process with occurs in both plants and soils. The balance of this absorption and release, called net ecosystem exchange, serves to reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations.

NEE gapfilling method = This contains the flag parameter for NEE gapfilled (0 = no gapfilling applied).

CO₂ concentration 67.2 m

CO₂ 67.2 m (ICOS AS) = CO2 concentration at 67.2 m but measured with different instrument.

Diffuse radiation = Energy is received from the sun in the form of shortwave radiation, some of which reaches the surface directly, while some is reflected, scattered, and absorbed by particles in the atmosphere, to reach the ground as diffuse radiation.

Diffuse PAR = Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) is light of wavelengths 400-700 nm and is the portion of the light spectrum utilised by plants for photosynthesis. Diffuse PAR is PAR scattered by air molecules.

Global radiation 18/35 m = Global radiation is the total amount of solar radiation.

Global radiation 67 m

H₂O 27 m (ICOS ES) = Water vapour concentration at 27 m height

Rainfall = Amount of rainfall (collected at bucket at 18m).

Precipitation = Amount of water in the form of rain, snow etc.

Soil water potential A = Soil water potential expresses how much energy you would need to expend to pull that water out of the soil sample, 
effects evaporation, transpiration, and ability of plants to absorb water.
